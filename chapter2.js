/*
Looping a triangle
Write a loop that makes seven calls to console.log to output the following triangle:

##
###
####
#####
######
#######

/*FizzBuzz
Write a program that uses console.log to print all the numbers from 1 to 100, with two exceptions. For numbers divisible by 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number, and for numbers divisible by 5 (and not 3), print "Buzz" instead.
When you have that working, modify your program to print "FizzBuzz" for numbers that are divisible by both 3 and 5 (and still print "Fizz" or "Buzz" for numbers divisible by only one of those).*/

/* Chessboard
Write a program that creates a string that represents an 8Ã—8 grid, using newline characters to separate lines. At each position of the grid there is either a space or a "#" character. The characters should form a chessboard.
Passing this string to console.log should show something like this:

    //When we set x+y every second number will be divisible by 2, therefore, every second character will execute the "" space character, and each new line will alternate between an even/odd number.

  }
  board += "\n";

  // \n creates a new line  this statement is attached to the loop for the y. So after the horizontal axis is done we go to a new line.
